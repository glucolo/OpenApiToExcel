# ðŸ“˜ API Documentation Generator from Swagger 2.0

This tool automates the creation of API documentation by converting a Swagger 2.0 (OpenAPI) JSON specification into a structured Excel file. It is designed to help developers, technical writers, and API consumers quickly visualize and understand the available endpoints in a RESTful API.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this tool is to simplify the process of documenting APIs by extracting all relevant information from a Swagger 2.0 specification and organizing it into a human-readable Excel spreadsheet.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Parses Swagger 2.0 JSON files  
- Extracts endpoint paths, HTTP methods, parameters, and descriptions  (TODO: responses)
- Outputs a well-formatted Excel file with separate sections for endpoints, parameters (TODO: and response codes)
- Useful for technical documentation, API reviews, and onboarding new developers

## ðŸ“ˆ Use Cases

- Generate up-to-date API documentation for internal or external use  
- Share API structure with non-developers in a familiar Excel format  
- Facilitate API audits and compliance checks
